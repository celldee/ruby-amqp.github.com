h1. Error handling and recovery

h2. About this guide

Development of a robust application, be it message publisher or message consumer, involves dealing withmultiple kinds of failures: protocol exceptions, network failures, broker failures and so on.Correct error handling and recovery is not easy. This guide explains how amqp gem helps you in dealing withissues like

 * Initial broker connection failures
 * Network connection interruption
 * AMQP connection-level exceptions
 * AMQP channel-level exceptions
 * Broker failure
 * TLS (SSL) related issues

as well as

 * How to recover after a network failure
 * What is automatic recovery mode, when you should and should not use it

h2. Covered versions

This guide covers "Ruby amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp v0.8.0.RC14 and later.

h2. Code examples

There are several {https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/tree/master/examples/error_handling examples}  in the git repository dedicated to the topic of error handling and recovery. Feelfree to contribute new examples.

h3. Initial broker connection failures

When applications connect to the broker, they need to handle connection failures. Networks are not 100% reliable, even with modern system configuration toolslike Chef or Puppet misconfigurations happen and broker might be down, too. Error detection should happen as early as possible. There are two ways of detectingTCP connection failure, the first one is to catch an exception:

<pre>begin
  AMQP.start(connection_settings) do |connection, open_ok|
    raise "This should not be reachable"
  end
rescue AMQP::TCPConnectionFailed => e
  puts "Caught AMQP::TCPConnectionFailed => TCP connection failed, as expected."
end</pre>

Full example:

{% example error_handling/initial_connection_recovery.rb, 1016238 %}

{AMQP.connect} (and {AMQP.start}) will raise {AMQP::TCPConnectionFailed} if connection fails. Code that catches it can write to logabout the issue or use retry to execute begin block one more time. Because initial connection failures are due to misconfiguration or network outage, reconnectionto the same endpoint (hostname, port, vhost combination) will result in the same issue over and over. TBD: failover, connection to the cluster.

Alternative way of handling connection failure is with an errback (a callback for specific kind of error):

<pre>handler             = Proc.new { |settings| puts "Failed to connect, as expected"; EventMachine.stop }
connection_settings = {
  :port     => 9689,
  :vhost    => "/amq_client_testbed",
  :user     => "amq_client_gem",
  :password => "amq_client_gem_password",
  :timeout        => 0.3,
  :on_tcp_connection_failure => handler
}</pre>

Full example:

{% example error_handling/tcp_connection_failure_fallback.rb, 1016235%}

:on_tcp_connection_failure option accepts any object that responds to #call.

If you connect to the broker from a code in a class (as opposed to top-level scope in a script), Object#method can be used to pass object method as a handlerinstead of a Proc.

TBD: provide an example

h3. Authentication failures

Another reason why connection may fail is authentication failure. Handling authentication failure is very similar to handling initial TCPconnection failure:

{% example error_handling/auth_failure_callback.rb, 1016233 %}

h4. Default handler

default handler raises {AMQP::PossibleAuthenticationFailureError}:

{% example error_handling/auth_failure_rescue.rb, 1016234 %}

In case you wonder why callback name has "possible" in it: {http://bit.ly/mTr1YN AMQP 0.9.1 spec} requires broker implementations tosimply close TCP connection without sending any more data when an exception (such as authentication failure) occurs before AMQP connectionis open. In practice, however, when broker closes TCP connection between successful TCP connection and before AMQP connection is open,it means that authentication has failed.

h2. Handling network connection interruptions

Network connectivity issues are sad fact of life in modern software systems. Event small products and projects these days consist of multipleapplications, often running on more than one machine. Ruby amqp gem detects TCP connection failures and lets you handle them bydefining a callback using {AMQP::Session#on_tcp_connection_loss}. That callback will be run when TCP connection fails, and will be passedtwo parameters: connection object and settings of the last successful connection.

<pre>connection.on_tcp_connection_loss do |connection, settings|
  # reconnect in 10 seconds, without enforcement
  connection.reconnect(false, 10)
end</pre>

Sometimes it is necessary for other entities in an application to react to network failures. amqp gem 0.8.0 and later provides a number eventhandlers to make this task easier for developers. This set of features is know as the "shutdown protocol" (the word "protocol" here means"API interface" or "behavior", not network protocol).

{AMQP::Session}, {AMQP::Channel}, {AMQP::Exchange}, {AMQP::Queue} and {AMQP::Consumer all implement shutdown protocol and thus errorhandling API is consistent for all classes, with {AMQP::Session} and #{AMQP::Channel} having a few methods other entities do not have.

The Shutdown protocol revolves around two events:
 * Network connection fails
 * Broker closes AMQP connection (or channel)

In this section, we concentrate only on the former. When network connection fails, the underlying networking library detects it andruns a piece of code on {AMQP::Session} to handle it. That, in turn, propagates this event to channels, channels propagate it toexchanges and queues, queues propagate it to their consumers (if any). Each of these entities in the object graph can reactto network interruption by executing application-defined callbacks.

h3. Shutdown Protocol methods on AMQP::Session

 * {AMQP::Session#on_tcp_connection_loss}
 * {AMQP::Session#on_connection_interruption}

The difference between these methods is that {AMQP::Session#on_tcp_connection_loss} is used to define a callback that willbe executed *once* when TCP connection fails. It is possible that reconnection attempts will not succeed immediately, sothere will be subsequent failures. To react to those, {AMQP::Session#on_connection_interruption} method is used.

First argument that both of these methods yield to the handler your application defines is the connection itself. This isdone to make sure you can register Ruby objects as handlers, and they do not have to keep any state around (for example,connection instances):

<pre>connection.on_connection_interruption do |conn|
  puts "Connection detected connection interruption"
end

# or

class ConnectionInterruptionHandler

  #
  # API
  #

  def handle(connection)
    # handling logic
  end

end

handler = ConnectionInterruptionHandler.new
connection.on_connection_interruption(&handler.method(:handle))</pre>

Note that {AMQP::Session#on_connection_interruption} callback is called *before* this event is propagated to channels, queues and so on.

Different applications handle connection failures differently. It is very common to use {AMQP::Session#reconnect} methodto schedule a reconnection to the same host, or use {AMQP::Session#reconnect_to} to connect to a different one.
For some applications it is OK to simply exit and wait to be restarted at a later point in time, for example, by a processmonitoring system like Nagios or Monit.

h3. Shutdown Protocol methods on AMQP::Channel

{AMQP::Channel} provides only one method: {AMQP::Channel#on_connection_interruption}, that registers a callback similar tothe one seen in the previous section:

<pre>channel.on_connection_interruption do |ch|
  puts "Channel #{ch.id} detected connection interruption"
end</pre>

Note that {AMQP::Channel#on_connection_interruption} callback is called *after* this event is propagated to exchanges, queues and so on.Right after that channel state is reset, except for error handling/recovery-related callbacks.

<span class="note">Many applications do not need per-channel network failure handling.
</span>

h3. Shutdown Protocol methods on AMQP::Exchange

{AMQP::Exchange} provides only one method: {AMQP::Exchange#on_connection_interruption}, that registers a callback similar tothe one seen in the previous section:

<pre>exchange.on_connection_interruption do |ex|
  puts "Exchange #{ex.name} detected connection interruption"
end</pre>

<span class="note">Many applications do not need per-exchange network failure handling.</span>

h3. Shutdown Protocol methods on AMQP::Queue

{AMQP::Queue} provides only one method: {AMQP::Queue#on_connection_interruption}, that registers a callback similar tothe one seen in the previous section:

<pre>queue.on_connection_interruption do |q|
  puts "Queue #{q.name} detected connection interruption"
end</pre>

Note that {AMQP::Queue#on_connection_interruption} callback is called *after* this event is propagated to consumers.

<span class="note">Many applications do not need per-queue network failure handling.</span>

h3. Shutdown Protocol methods on AMQP::Consumer

{AMQP::Consumer} provides only one method: {AMQP::Consumer#on_connection_interruption}, that registers a callback similar tothe one seen in the previous section:

<pre>consumer.on_connection_interruption do |c|
  puts "Consumer with consumer tag #{c.consumer_tag} detected connection interruption"
end</pre>

<span class="note">Many applications do not need per-consumer network failure handling.</span>

h2. Recovering from network connection failures

Detecting network connections is nearly useless if AMQP-based application cannot recover from them. Recovery is the hard partin "error handling and recovery". Fortunately, recovery process for many applications follows one simple scheme that amqpgem can perform automatically for you.

<span class="note">Recovery process, both manual and automatic, always begins with re-opening AMQP connection and then all the channels on that connection.</span>

h3. Manual recovery

Similarly to the Shutdown Protocol, amqp gem entities implement Recovery Protocol. Recovery Protocol consists of 3 methodsconnections, channels, queues, consumers and exchanges implement:
 * {AMQP::Session#before_recovery}
 * {AMQP::Session#auto_recover}
 * {AMQP::Session#after_recovery}

{AMQP::Session#before_recovery} lets application developers register a callback that will be executed *after TCP connection isre-established but before AMQP connection is reopened*. {AMQP::Session#after_recovery} is similar except that the callback is run*after AMQP connection is reopened*.

{AMQP::Channel}, {AMQP::Queue}, {AMQP::Consumer} and {AMQP::Exchange} methods behavior is identical.

Recovery process for AMQP applications usually involves the following steps:

 # Re-open AMQP connection.
 # Once connection is open again, re-open all AMQP channels on that connection.
 # For each channel, re-declare all exchanges
 # For each channel, re-declare all queues
 # Once queue is declared, for each queue, re-register all bindings # Once queue is declared, for each queue, re-register all consumers

h3. Automatic recovery

Many applications use the same recovery strategy, that consists of the following steps:
 * Re-open channels
 * For each channel, re-declare exchanges
 * For each channel, re-declare queues
 * For each queue, recover all bindings
 * For each queue, recover all consumers

amqp gem provides a feature known as "automatic recovery" that is *opt-in* (not opt-out, not used by default) and lets applicationdevelopers get aforementioned recovery strategy by setting one additional attribute on {AMQP::Channel} instance:

<pre>ch = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
ch.auto_recovery = true</pre>


A more verbose way to do the same thing:
<pre>ch = AMQP::Channel.new(connection, AMQP::Channel.next_channel_id, :auto_recovery => true)</pre>

Note that if you do not want to pass any options, 2nd argument can be left out as well,then it will default to {AMQP::Channel.next_channel_id}.

To find out whether channel uses automatic recovery mode, use {AMQP::Channel#auto_recovering?}.

Auto recovery mode can be turned on and off any number of times during channel life cycle, although very small percentage ofapplications really does this. Typically you decide what channels should be using automatic recovery at application designstage.

Full example (run it, then shut down AMQP broker running on localhost, then bring it back up and use management tools such as `rabbitmqctl`to see that queues & bindings & consumer have all recovered):

{% example error_handling/automatic_recovery_of_queues_bindings_and_consumers_example.rb, 1048076 %}

Server-named queues, when recovered automatically, will get *new server-generated names* to guarantee there are no name collisions.

<span note="class">When in doubt, try using automatic recovery first. If it is not sufficient for you application, switch to manualrecovery using events and callbacks introduced in the "Manual recovery" section.</span>

h2. Detecting broker failures

AMQP applications see broker failure as TCP connection loss. There is no reliable way to know whether there is a network splitor network peer is down.

h2. AMQP connection-level exceptions

h3. Handling connection-level exceptions

Connection-level exceptions are rare and may indicate a serious issue with client library or in-flight data corruption. They mandatethat connection cannot be used any more and must be closed. In any case, your application should be prepared to handle this kind of errors.To define a handler, use {AMQP::Session#on_error} method that takes a callback and yields two arguments to it when connection-level exception happens:

<pre>connection.on_error do |conn, connection_close|
  puts "Handling a connection-level exception."
  puts
  puts "AMQP class id : #{connection_close.class_id}"
  puts "AMQP method id: #{connection_close.method_id}"
  puts "Status code   : #{connection_close.reply_code}"
  puts "Error message : #{connection_close.reply_text}"
end</pre>

Status codes are similar to those of HTTP. For the full list of error codes and their meaning, consult {http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#constants AMQP 0.9.1 constants reference}.

<span class="note">Only one connection-level exception handler can be defined per connection instance (the one added last replaces previously added ones).</span>

Full example:

{% example error_handling/connection_level_exception.rb, 1015966 %}

h2. Handling graceful broker shutdown

When AMQP broker is shut down, it properly closes connection first. To do so, it uses *connection.close* AMQP method. AMQP clients thenneed to check if the reply code is equal to 320 (CONNECTION_FORCED) to distinguish graceful shutdown. With RabbitMQ, when brokeris stopped using

<code>rabbitmqctl stop</code>

reply_text will be set to

<code>CONNECTION_FORCED - broker forced connection closure with reason 'shutdown'</code>

Each application choose how to handle graceful broker shutdowns individually, so *amqp gem's automatic reconnection does not cover graceful broker shutdowns*.Applications that want to reconnect when broker is stopped can use {AMQP::Session#periodically_reconnect} like so:

<pre>connection.on_error do |conn, connection_close|
  puts "[connection.close] Reply code = #{connection_close.reply_code}, reply text = #{connection_close.reply_text}"
  if connection_close.reply_code == 320
    puts "[connection.close] Setting up a periodic reconnection timer..."
    # every 30 seconds
    conn.periodically_reconnect(30)
  end
end</pre>

Once AMQP connection is re-opened, channels in automatic recovery mode will recover just like they do after network outages.

h2. Integrating channel-level exceptions handling with object-oriented Ruby code

Error handling can be easily integrated into object-oriented Ruby code (in fact, this is highly encouraged).A common technique is to combine {http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/1.8.7/Object:method Object#method} and {http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/1.8.7/Method:to_proc Method#to_proc}and use object methods as error handlers:

<pre>class ConnectionManager

  #
  # API
  #

  def connect(*args, &block)
    @connection = AMQP.connect(*args, &block)

    # combines Object#method and Method#to_proc to use object
    # method as a callback
    @connection.on_error(&method(:on_error))
  end # connect(*args, &block)


  def on_error(connection, connection_close)
    puts "Handling a connection-level exception."
    puts
    puts "AMQP class id : #{connection_close.class_id}"
    puts "AMQP method id: #{connection_close.method_id}"
    puts "Status code   : #{connection_close.reply_code}"
    puts "Error message : #{connection_close.reply_text}"
  end # on_error(connection, connection_close)
end</pre>

Full example that uses objects:

{% example error_handling/connection_level_exception_with_ruby_objects.rb, 1016049 %}

TBD

h2. AMQP channel-level exceptions

h3. Hanling channel-level exceptions

Channel-level exceptions are more common than connection-level ones. They are handled in a similar manner, by defining a callbackwith {AMQP::Channel#on_error} method that takes a callback and yields two arguments to it when channel-level exception happens:

<pre>channel.on_error do |ch, channel_close|
  puts "Handling a channel-level exception."
  puts
  puts "AMQP class id : #{channel_close.class_id}"
  puts "AMQP method id: #{channel_close.method_id}"
  puts "Status code   : #{channel_close.reply_code}"
  puts "Error message : #{channel_close.reply_text}"
end</pre>

Status codes are similar to those of HTTP. For the full list of error codes and their meaning, consult {http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#constants AMQP 0.9.1 constants reference}.

<span class="note">Only one channel-level exception handler can be defined per channel instance (the one added last replaces previously added ones).</span>

Full example:

{% example error_handling/amqp_gem_channel_level_exception_handling.rb, 1016042 %}

h3. Integrating channel-level exceptions handling with object-oriented Ruby code

Error handling can be easily integrated into object-oriented Ruby code (in fact, this is highly encouraged).A common technique is to combine {http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/1.8.7/Object:method Object#method} and {http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/1.8.7/Method:to_proc Method#to_proc}and use object methods as error handlers. For example of this, see section on connection-level exceptions above.

<span class="note">Because channel-level exceptions may be raised because of multiple unrelated reasons and often indicate misconfigurations, how they are handled isvery specific to particular applications. A common strategy is to log an error and then open and use another channel.</span>

h3. Common channel-level exceptions and what they mean

A few channel-level exceptions are common and deserve more attention.

h4. 406 Precondition Failed

Maybe two applications or pieces of code declare the same entity with different attributes. Note that different AMQP client libraries historically use slightly different defaults for entities and this may cause attribute mismatches.</li>
      <li>{AMQP::Channel#tx_commit} or {AMQP::Channel#tx_rollback} might be run on a channel that wasn't previously made transactional with {AMQP::Channel#tx_select}</li>

h2. TLS (SSL) related issues
TBD

h2. Conclusion

Distributed applications introduce a whole new class of failres developers need to be aware of. Many of them come fromunreliability of the network. The famous "Fallacies of Distributed Computing":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing listcommon assumptions software engineers must not make:

 * The network is reliable.
 * Latency is zero.
 * Bandwidth is infinite.
 * The network is secure.
 * Topology doesn't change.
 * There is one administrator.
 * Transport cost is zero.
 * The network is homogeneous.

Unfortunately, applications that use Ruby and AMQP are not immune to these problems and developers need to always keep thatin mind. This list is just as relevant in 2011 as it was in the 90s.

Ruby amqp gem 0.8.x and later lets applications to define handlers that handle connection-level exceptions, channel-levelexceptions and TCP connection failures. Handling AMQP exceptions and network connection failures is relatively easy.Re-declaring AMQP instances application works with is where the most of complexity comes from. By using Ruby objects aserror handlers, declaration of AMQP entities can be done in one place, making it much easier to understand and maintain.

amqp gem error handling and interruption is not a copy of RabbitMQ Java client's "Shutdown Protocol":http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#shutdown,but they turn out to be similar with respect to network failures and connection-level exceptions.
