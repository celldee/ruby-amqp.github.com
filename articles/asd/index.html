h1. Domains

h2. Fields:
	* Domain name
  * Add description field in the domain
	* Publisher
	* Tags
    * Domain has it's own tags, but it also shows the tags of it's pages in type of a tag-cloud (the more pages have certain tag, the "bolder" the tag is).
	* Domain-wide pricing
		* Startpage
		* Level 1
		* Level 2

Possible other fields
  * alexa rank
  * Indexed pages (amount of pages that Google has indexed)

h1. Pages (belong to domain)

When we're creating a domain, we add the information how much certain link is worth:
	Top-level link would be 5$ for monthly and 100$ for single payment
	Sub-directory link would be 5$ for monthly and 100$ for single payment
	2nd-level	 link would be 5$ for monthly and 100$ for single payment
	When we add a page that's connected to the domain, we can override the price inside of certain sub-directory.


h2. Fields
	* URL
	* Tags
	* Price (if field is blank, use the default price)
	* After crawling we can get to know:
		* Title (fetch from URL)
		* Level
		* If page is online (i assume that we should not only verify that page is online, but also that link is still there, right)

Level examples:
  Homepage: Level 1
  Homepage.de/fashion/: Level 2
  Homepage.de/fashion/purses/: Level 3

h1. Link Placement

h2. Fields
  * URL that the link is pointing to
  * Anchortext
  * Page the Link is conneted to
	* advertiser (or campaign)
	* publisher through domain and page

h2. Kinds of link placements

	* Monthly payment (rented link) (has to be up for at least 3 month), default cancellation time is 1 month.
		Monthly payment links are necessarily on the main page of the website (for isntance, links about Car Insurance can be under "http://abc.com/car_insurance/"

	* Single payment (mostly for new blog entries/posts), so it has to be online for at least 2 years.
		It's mostly new blog posts. And the link should be somewhere inside of the content area.
		We don't want to add a page for every single post.


h1. Proposals

Basic worflow, how to create proposals.

  * Search Database for certain keywords (keywords mentioned where? you mean tags? or keywords / links?)
  * Advertisers would be searching for keywords that they actually wanna have in their link anchor text (for example “Hotel Munich”). We should be able to determine wich subpages of the domains within our system would fit this keyword from a semantic point of view the best.

Kinds of proposals:
	* filter all the domains that we have for certain keywords (tags), and create the list of domains that suite. Add an ability to export that list as CSV.
	* We get a list of suitable domains from advertiser
	* so we need a list of suitable sub-pages.

Second kind of proposal: only description of the domain is displayed.


h1. Payment structure

We get money from advertiser, and transfer money to publisher.
Affiliate gets a part of money that we made with this publisher.

Affiliate:
	* Percentage field (how much affiliate makes of the winnings)
	* So, basic forumulae for it is

    (How much we got from Advertiser MINUS How much we paid to Publisher) / 10(percentage)

Payments to publishers:
a) percentage of what we earn (bigger publishers)
b) certain amount of money for the certain directory (per-link payments)
c) we pay a certain amount of money per month and we can sell as many links as we want to (quite rare, but happens sometimes).
