<h2>High-level overview of <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 and the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> Model</h2>
<h3>What is <span class="caps">AMQP</span></h3>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span> (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is a networking protocol which enables conforming client applications to communicate with conforming messaging middleware brokers.</p>
<h3>Why <span class="caps">AMQP</span> was created</h3>
<p>Messaging solutions have been around since the 1970s with a view to solving the problem of integrating incompatible products from diverse vendors. Without the use of messaging middleware, the integration of heterogenous systems has proved to be very expensive and complex. However, messaging solutions, such as <span class="caps">IBM</span> Websphere MQ and Tibco Enterprise Message Service, are also very costly and tend to be exclusively employed by large companies (who can afford them), especially those in the financial services industry.</p>
<p>There is also a problem with interoperability between messaging solutions. Vendors have created their own proprietary messaging protocols which do not interoperate with others, therefore resulting in &#8216;vendor lock-in&#8217;.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span> has multiple design goals but two of the most important are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To produce an open standard for messaging middleware</li>
	<li>To enable interoperability between various technologies and platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of software running on many operating systems built with multiple programming languages running on various hardware architectures and virtual machines. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> not only makes it possible for these disparate systems to communicate with one another, but also enables different products that implement <span class="caps">AMQP</span> to exchange information.</p>
<h3>Brokers and their role</h3>
<p>Messaging brokers receive messages from <em>producers</em> (applications that publish them) and route them to <em>consumers</em> (applications that process them).</p>
<p>If you imagine the human body, then brokers would be equivalent to centers of the nervous system and applications would be more like limbs.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Model in brief</h3>
<p>The <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Model has the following view of the world: messages are published by producers to <em>exchanges</em>, often compared to post offices or mailboxes. Exchanges then distribute message copies to <em>queues</em> using rules called <em>bindings</em>. Then <span class="caps">AMQP</span> brokers either push messages to <em>consumers</em> subscribed to queues, or consumers fetch/pull messages from queues on demand.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/raw/master/docs/diagrams/001_hello_world_example_routing.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When publishing a message, producers may specify various <em>message attributes</em> (message metadata). Some of this metadata may be used by the broker, however, the rest of it is completely opaque to the broker and is only used by applications that receive the message.</p>
<p>Networks are unreliable and applications may fail to process messages, therefore the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> Model has a notion of <em>message acknowledgements</em>: when a message is pushed down to a consumer, the consumer <em>notifies the broker</em>, either automatically or as soon as the application developer chooses to do so. When message acknowledgements are in use, a broker will only completely remove a message from a queue when it receives a notification for that message (or group of messages).</p>
<p>In certain situations, for example, when a message cannot be routed, messages may be <em>returned</em> to producers, dropped, or, if the broker implements an extension, placed into a so-called &#8220;dead letter queue&#8221;. Producers choose how to handle situations like this by publishing messages using certain parameters.</p>
<p>Queues, exchanges and bindings are commonly referred to as <em><span class="caps">AMQP</span> entities</em>.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">AMQP</span> is a Programmable Protocol</h3>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 is a programmable protocol in the sense that <span class="caps">AMQP</span> entities and routing schemes are defined by applications themselves, not a broker administrator. Accordingly, provision is made for protocol operations that declare queues and exchanges, define bindings between them, subscribe to queues and so on.</p>
<p>This gives application developers a lot of freedom but also requires them to be aware of potential definition conflicts. In practice, definition conflicts are rare and often indicate misconfigurations. This can be very useful as it is a good thing if misconfigurations are caught early.</p>
<p>Applications declare the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> entities that they need, define necessary routing schemes and may choose to delete <span class="caps">AMQP</span> entities when they are no longer used.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Exchanges and Exchange Types</h2>
<p><em>Exchanges</em> are <span class="caps">AMQP</span> entities where messages are sent. Exchanges then take a message and route it into one or more (or no) queues. The routing algorithm used depends on <em>exchange type</em> and rules called <em>bindings</em>. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 brokers typically provide 4 exchange types out of the box:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Direct exchange (typically used for for 1-to-1 communication or unicasting)</li>
	<li>Fanout exchange (1-to-n communication or broadcasting)</li>
	<li>Topic exchange (1-to-n or n-to-m communication, multicasting)</li>
	<li>Headers exchange (message metadata-based routing)</li>
</ul>
<p>but it is possible to extend <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 brokers with custom exchange types, for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>x-random exchange (randomly chooses a queue to route incoming messages to)</li>
	<li>x-recent-history (a fanout exchange that also keeps N recent messages in memory)</li>
	<li>regular expressions based variations of headers exchange</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Besides the type, exchanges have a number of attributes, most imprortant of which are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Name</li>
	<li>Can be durable (information about them is persisted to disk and thus survives broker restarts) or non-durable (information is only kept in <span class="caps">RAM</span>)</li>
	<li>Can have metadata associated with them on declaration</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Queues</h2>
<p>Queues in the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> Model are very similar to queues in other message and &#8220;task queueing&#8221; systems: they store messages that are consumed by applications. Like <span class="caps">AMQP</span> exchanges, an <span class="caps">AMQP</span> queue has a name and a durability property but also</p>
<ul>
	<li>Can be exclusive (used by only one connection)</li>
	<li>Can be automatically deleted when last consumer unsubscribes</li>
	<li>Can have metadata associated with them on declaration (some brokers use it to implement features like message <span class="caps">TTL</span>)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Bindings</h2>
<p>Bindings are rules that exchanges use (among other things) to route messages to queues. To instruct an exchange E to route messages to a queue Q, Q has to <em>be bound</em> to E. Bindings may have an optional <em>routing key</em> attribute used by some exchange types. The purpose of the routing key is to selectively match only specific (matching) messages published to an exchange to the bound queue. In other words, the routing key acts like a filter.</p>
<p>To draw an analogy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Queue is like your destination in New York city</li>
	<li>Exchange is like <span class="caps">JFK</span> airport</li>
	<li>Bindings are routes from <span class="caps">JFK</span> to your destination. There can be none or more than one way to reach it</li>
</ul>
<p>Having this layer of indirection enables routing scenarios that are impossible of very hard to implement using publishing directly to queues and also eliminates certain amount of duplicated work application developers have to do.</p>
<p>If <span class="caps">AMQP</span> message cannot be routed to any queue (for example, because there are no bindings for the exchange it was published to), it is either dropped or returned to the publisher, depending on message attributes the publisher has set.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Message Consumers</h2>
<p>Storing messages in queues is useless unless applications can <em>consume</em> them. In the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Model, there are two ways for applications to do this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have messages pushed to them (&#8220;push <span class="caps">API</span>&#8221;)</li>
	<li>Fetch messages as needed (&#8220;pull <span class="caps">API</span>&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the &#8220;push <span class="caps">API</span>&#8221;, applications have to indicate interest in consuming messages from a particular queue. When they do so, we say that they <em>register a consumer</em> or, simply put, <em>subscribe to a queue</em>. It is possible to have more than one consumer per queue or to register an <em>exclusive consumer</em> (excludes all other consumers from the queue while it is consuming).</p>
<p>Each consumer (subscription) has an identifier called a <em>consumer tag</em>. It can be used to unsubscribe from messages. Consumer tags are just strings.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Message Attributes and Payload</h2>
<p>Messages in the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> Model have <em>attributes</em>. Some attributes are so common that the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> v0.9.1 specification defines them and application developers do not have to think about the exact attribute name. Some examples are</p>
<ul>
	<li>Content type</li>
	<li>Content encoding</li>
	<li>Routing key</li>
	<li>Delivery mode (persistent or not)</li>
	<li>Message priority</li>
	<li>Message publishing timestamp</li>
	<li>Expiration period</li>
	<li>Producer application id</li>
</ul>
<p>Some attributes are used by <span class="caps">AMQP</span> brokers, but most are open to interpretation by applications that receive them. Some attributes are optional and known as <em>headers</em>. They are similar to X-Headers in <span class="caps">HTTP</span>. Message attributes are set when a message is published.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span> messages also have a <em>payload</em> (the data that they carry). Brokers treat this data as opaque (it is neither modified nor used by them). It is possible for messages to contain only attributes and no payload. It is common to use serialization formats like <span class="caps">JSON</span>, Thrift, Protocol Buffers and MessagePack to serialize structured data in order to publish it as <span class="caps">AMQP</span> message payload.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Message Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>Since networks are unreliable and applications fail, it is often necessary to have some kind of &#8220;processing acknowledgement&#8221;. Sometimes it is only necessary to acknowledge the fact that a message has been received. Sometimes acknowledgements mean that a message was validated and processed by a consumer, for example, verified as having mandatory data and persisted to a data store or indexed.</p>
<p>This situation is very common, so <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 has a built-in feature called <em>message acknowledgements</em> (sometimes referred to as <em>acks</em>) that consumers use to confirm message delivery and/or processing. If an application crashes (<span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker notices this when connection is closed), if an acknowledgement for a message was expected but not received by the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker, the message is re-queued (and possibly immediately delivered to another consumer, if any exists).</p>
<p>Having acknowledgements built into the protocol helps developers to build more robust software.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Methods</h2>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 is structured as a number of <em>methods</em>. Methods are operations (like <span class="caps">HTTP</span> methods) and have nothing in common with methods in object-oriented programming languages. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> methods are grouped into <em>classes</em>. Classes are just logical groupings of <span class="caps">AMQP</span> methods. The <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html"><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 reference</a> can be found on  the RabbitMQ website.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at the <em>exchange.*</em> class, a group of methods related to operations on exchanges. It includes the following operations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>exchange.declare</li>
	<li>exchange.declare-ok</li>
	<li>exchange.delete</li>
	<li>exchange.delete-ok</li>
</ul>
<p>(note that the RabbitMQ site reference also includes RabbitMQ-specific extensions to the exchange.* class that we will not discuss in this guide).</p>
<p>The operations above form logical pairs: <strong>exchange.declare</strong> and <strong>exchange.declare-ok</strong>, <strong>exchange.delete</strong> and <strong>exchange.delete-ok</strong>. These operations are &#8220;requests&#8221; (sent by clients) and &#8220;responses&#8221; (sent by brokers in response to the aforementioned &#8220;requests&#8221;).</p>
<p>As an example, the client asks the broker to declare a new exchange using the <strong>exchange.declare</strong> method:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110720-c4qjdhmdrih9bn56npqnic4die.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>As shown on the diagram above, <strong>exchange.declare</strong> carries several <em>parameters</em>. They enable the client to specify exchange name, type, durability flag and so on.</p>
<p>If the operation succeeds, the broker responds with the <strong>exchange.declare-ok</strong> method:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110720-m4ptjbnex2sa52g6wdwj3e9ahm.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>exchange.declare-ok</strong> does not carry any parameters except for the channel number (channels will be described later in this guide).</p>
<p>The sequence of events is very similar for another method pair, <strong>queue.declare</strong> and <strong>queue.declare-ok</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110720-tmxswrie71ubb5m5nh8n17idhk.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110720-g67urxg75c71qtwhwsjs684323.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Not all <span class="caps">AMQP</span> methods have counterparts. Some (<strong>basic.publish</strong> being the most widely used one) do not have corresponding &#8220;response&#8221; methods and some others (<strong>basic.get</strong>, for example) have more than one possible &#8220;response&#8221;.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Connections</h2>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span> connections are typically long-lived. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> is an application level protocol that uses <span class="caps">TCP</span> for reliable delivery. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> connections use authentication and can be protected using <span class="caps">TLS</span> (<span class="caps">SSL</span>). When an application no longer needs to be connected to an <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker, it should gracefully close the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> connection instead of abruptly closing the underlying <span class="caps">TCP</span> connection.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Channels</h2>
<p>Some applications need multiple connections to an <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker. However, it is undesirable to keep many <span class="caps">TCP</span> connections open at the same time because doing so consumes system resources and makes it more difficult to configure firewalls. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 connections are multiplexed with <em>channels</em> that can be thought of as &#8220;lightweight connections that share a single <span class="caps">TCP</span> connection&#8221;.</p>
<p>For applications that use multiple threads/processes/etc for processing, it is very common to open a new channel per thread (process, etc.) and <strong>not share</strong> channels between them.</p>
<p>Communication on a particular channel is completely separate from communication on another channel, therefore every <span class="caps">AMQP</span> method also carries a channel number that clients use to figure out which channel the method is for (and thus, which event handler needs to be invoked, for example).</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> Virtual Hosts (vhosts)</h2>
<p>To make it possible for a single broker to host multiple isolated &#8220;environments&#8221; (groups of users, exchanges, queues and so on), <span class="caps">AMQP</span> includes the concept of <em>virtual hosts</em> (vhosts). They are similar to virtual hosts used by many popular Web servers and provide completely isolated environments in which <span class="caps">AMQP</span> entities live. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> clients specify what vhosts they want to use during <span class="caps">AMQP</span> connection negotiation.</p>
<p>An <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 vhost name can be any non-blank string. Some most common use cases for vhosts are</p>
<ul>
	<li>To separate <span class="caps">AMQP</span> entities used by different groups of applications</li>
	<li>To separate multiple installations/environments (e.g. production, staging) of one or more applications</li>
	<li>To implement a multi-tenant environment</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> is Extensible</h2>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 has several extension points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Custom exchange types let developers implement routing schemes that exchange types provided out-of-the-box do not cover well, for example, geodata-based routing.</li>
	<li>Declaration of exchanges and queues can include additional attributes that the broker can use. For example, per-queue message <span class="caps">TTL</span> in RabbitMQ is implemented this way.</li>
	<li>Broker-specific extensions to the protocol. See, for example, <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html">extensions RabbitMQ implements</a>.</li>
	<li>New <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 method classes can be introduced.</li>
	<li>Brokers can be extended with additional plugins, for example, RabbitMQ management frontend and <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> are implemented as a plugin.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features make the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Model even more flexible and applicable to a very broad range of problems.</p>
<h2>Key differences from some other messaging models</h2>
<p>One key difference to understand about the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Model is that <strong>messages are not sent to queues. They are sent to exchanges that route them to queues according to rules called &#8220;bindings&#8221;</strong>. This means that routing is primarily handled by <span class="caps">AMQP</span> brokers and not applications themselves.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TBD</span></p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 clients ecosystem</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>There are many <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 clients for many popular programming languages and platforms. Some of them follow <span class="caps">AMQP</span> terminology closely and only provide implementation of <span class="caps">AMQP</span> methods. Some others have additional features, convenience methods and abstractions. Some of the clients are asynchronous (non-blocking), some are synchronous (blocking), some support both models. Some clients support vendor-specific extensions (for example, RabbitMQ-specific extensions).</p>
<p>Because one of the main <span class="caps">AMQP</span> goals is interoperability, it is a good idea for developers to understand protocol operations and not limit themselves to terminology of a particular client library. This way communicating with developers using different libraries will be significantly easier.</p>
