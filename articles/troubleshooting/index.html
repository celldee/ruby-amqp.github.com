  <h1>Troubleshooting and debugging AMQP applications</h1>
</div>
<div class='toc'></div>
<h2>About this guide</h2>
<p>This guide describes tools and strategies that help in troubleshooting and debugging applications that use <span class="caps">AMQP</span> in general and <a href="http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp">Ruby <span class="caps">AMQP</span> gem</a> in particular.</p>
<h2>Covered versions</h2>
<p>This guide covers <a href="http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp">Ruby amqp gem</a> v0.8.0 and later.</p>
<h2>First steps</h2>
<p>Whenever something doesn&#8217;t work, check the following things before asking on the mailing list:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker log.</li>
	<li>List of users in a particular vhost you are trying to connect.</li>
	<li>Network connectivity. We know, it&#8217;s obvious, yet even experienced developers and devops engineers struggle with network access misconfigurations every once in a while.</li>
	<li>If EventMachine is started in a separate thread, make sure that isn&#8217;t dead. If it is, this usually means there was an exception that caused it to terminate, or environment it is running in <a href="http://bit.ly/fork-and-threads">mixes threads and fork(2) system call</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inspecting <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker log file</h2>
<p>In this section we will cover typical problems that can be tracked down by reading <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker log. We will use RabbitMQ as an example, however, different <span class="caps">AMQP</span> brokers often log most of the same issues.</p>
<p>RabbitMQ logs abrupt <span class="caps">TCP</span> connection failures, timeouts, protocol version mismatches and so on. If you are running RabbitMQ, log locations for various operating systems and distributions is documented in the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html">RabbitMQ installation guide</a></p>
<p>On Mac OS X, RabbitMQ installed via Homebrew logs to $HOMEBREW_HOME/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit@$<span class="caps">HOSTNAME</span>.log. For example, if you have Homebrew installed at /usr/local and your hostname is giove, log will be at /usr/local/var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit@giove.log.</p>
<p>Here is what authentication failure looks like in RabbitMQ log:</p>
<p><code>=ERROR REPORT==== 17-May-2011::17:37:58 ===
exception on TCP connection &lt;0.4770.0&gt; from 127.0.0.1:46551
{channel0_error,starting,
                {amqp_error,access_refused,
                            "AMQPLAIN login refused: user 'pipeline_agent' - invalid credentials",
                            'connection.start_ok'}}</code></p>
<p>This means that connection attempt with username pipeline_agent failed because credentials were invalid. If you are seeing this message, make sure username, password <strong>and vhost</strong> are correct.</p>
<p>The following entry:</p>
<p><code>=ERROR REPORT==== 17-May-2011::17:26:28 ===
exception on TCP connection &lt;0.4201.62&gt; from 10.8.0.30:57990
{bad_header,&lt;&lt;65,77,81,80,0,0,9,1&gt;&gt;}</code></p>
<p>Means that client supports <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 but broker doesn&#8217;t (RabbitMQ versions pre-2.0 only support <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.8, for example). If you are using amqp gem 0.8 or later and seeing this entry in your broker log, you are connecting to <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker that is too old to support this <span class="caps">AMQP</span> version. In case of RabbitMQ, make sure you run version 2.0 or later.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TBD</span></p>
<h2>Handling channel-level exceptions</h2>
<p>A broad range of problems result in <span class="caps">AMQP</span> channel exceptions: an indication by the broker that there was an issue application needs to be aware of. Channel-level exceptions are typically not fatal and can be recovered from. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Exchange is re-declared with attributes different from the original declaration. For example, a non-durable exchange is being re-declared as durable.</li>
	<li>Queue is re-declared with attributes different from the original declaration. For example, an autodeletable queue is being re-declared as non-autodeletable.</li>
	<li>Queue is bound to an exchange that does not exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. When troubleshooting <span class="caps">AMQP</span> applications, it is recommended that you detect and handle channel-level exceptions on all channels your application may use. For that, use <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Channel#on_error-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel#on_error</a> method as demonstrated below:</p>
<pre>events_channel.on_error do |ch, channel_close|
  puts "Channel-level exception on the events channel: #{channel_close.reply_text}"
end

commands_channel.on_error do |ch, channel_close|
  puts "Channel-level exception on the commands channel: #{channel_close.reply_text}"
end</pre>
<p>Defining channel-level exception handlers will reveal many issues that it might take more time to detect using other troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<h2>Testing network connection with <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker using Telnet</h2>
<p>One simple way to check network connection between a particular network node and a node running <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker is to use `telnet`:</p>
<p><code>telnet [host or ip] 5672</code></p>
<p>then enter any random string of text and hit Enter. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker should immediately close down the connection. Here is an example session:</p>
<p><code>telnet localhost 5672
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
adjasd
AMQP    Connection closed by foreign host.</code></p>
<p>If instead Telnet exits after printing</p>
<p><code>telnet: connect to address [host or ip]: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host</code></p>
<p>then connection from the machine you are running Telnet tests on and <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker fails. This can be due to many different reasons, but it is a good idea to check these two things first:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Firewall configuration for port 5672</li>
	<li><span class="caps">DNS</span> setup (if hostname is used)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Broker Startup Issues</h2>
<h3>Missing erlang-os-mon on Debian and Ubuntu</h3>
<p>The following error on RabbitMQ startup on Debian or Ubuntu</p>
<p><code>ERROR: failed to load application os_mon: {"no such file or directory","os_mon.app"}</code></p>
<p>suggests that <strong>erlang-os-mon</strong> package is not installed.</p>
