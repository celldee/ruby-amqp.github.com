<h1>Bindings</h1>
<h2>About this guide</h2>
<p>This guide covers bindings in <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1, what they are, what role do they play and how to accomplish typical operations usingRuby amqp gem.</p>
<p>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a> (including images &amp; stylesheets). The source is available <a href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/tree/master/docs">on Github</a>.</p>
<h2>Covered versions</h2>
<p>This guide covers <a href="http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp">Ruby amqp gem</a> v0.8.0 and later.</p>
<h2>Bindings in <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1</h2>
<p>Bindings are rules that exchanges use (among other things) to route messages to queues. To instruct an exchange E to route messages to a queue Q,Q has to <em>be bound</em> to E. Bindings may have an optional <em>routing key</em> attribute used by some exchange types. The purpose of the routing key is toselectively match only specific (matching) messages published to an exchange to the bound queue. In other words, the routing key acts like a filter.</p>
<p>Learn more about how bindings fit into the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> Model in the <a href="/articles/amqp_9_1_model_explained/"><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Model Explained</a> documentation guide.</p>
<h2>What Are <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Bindings</h2>
<p>Bindings are rules that exchanges use (among other things) to route messages to queues. To instruct an exchange E to route messages to a queue Q,Q has to <em>be bound</em> to E. Bindings may have an optional <em>routing key</em> attribute used by some exchange types. The purpose of the routing key is toselectively match only specific (matching) messages published to an exchange to the bound queue. In other words, the routing key acts like a filter.</p>
<p>To draw an analogy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Queue is like your destination in New York city</li>
	<li>Exchange is like <span class="caps">JFK</span> airport</li>
	<li>Bindings are routes from <span class="caps">JFK</span> to your destination. There can be none or more than one way to reach it</li>
</ul>
<p>Some exchange types use routing key while some others do not (and route messages unconditionally or based on message metadata).If <span class="caps">AMQP</span> message cannot be routed to any queue (for example, because there are no bindings for the exchange it was published to), it is eitherdropped or returned to the publisher, depending on message attributes the publisher has set.</p>
<p>If application wants to connect a queue to an exchange, it needs to <em>bind</em> them. The opposite operation is called <em>unbinding</em>.</p>
<h2>Binding queues to exchanges</h2>
<p>In order to receive messages, a queue needs to be bound to at least one exchange. Most of the time binding is explcit(done by applications). To bind a queue to an exchange, use <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Queue#bind-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue#bind</a> where the argument passed can beeither an <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Exchange"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Exchange</a> instance or a string.</p>
<pre>queue.bind(exchange) do |bind_ok|
  puts "Just bound #{queue.name} to #{exchange.name}"
end</pre>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "amqp"

# Declaring a queue with explicitly given name using AMQP::Queue constructor
AMQP.start("amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com") do |connection, open_ok|
  channel = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
  queue   = AMQP::Queue.new(channel, "images.resize", :auto_delete =&gt; true)

  puts "#{queue.name} is ready to go."

  connection.close {
    EventMachine.stop { exit }
  }
end
</pre><p><span class="help-block">(if the example above isn&#8217;t displayed, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/998727">gist</a>)</span></p>
<p>The same example using a string without callback:</p>
<pre>queue.bind("amq.fanout")</pre>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "amqp"

# Binding a queue to an exchange
AMQP.start("amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com") do |connection, open_ok|
  channel = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
  exchange_name = "amq.fanout"

  channel.queue("", :auto_delete =&gt; true, :exclusive =&gt; true) do |queue, declare_ok|
    queue.bind(exchange_name)
    puts "Bound #{queue.name} to #{exchange_name}"

    connection.close {
      EventMachine.stop { exit }
    }
  end
end
</pre><p><span class="help-block">(if the example above isn&#8217;t displayed, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/998729">gist</a>)</span></p>
<h2>Unbinding queues from exchanges</h2>
<p>To unbind a queue from an exchange use <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Queue#unbind-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue#unbind</a>:</p>
<pre>queue.unbind(exchange)</pre>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "amqp"

AMQP.start("amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com") do |connection, open_ok|
  channel = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
  channel.on_error do |ch, channel_close|
    raise "Channel-level exception: #{channel_close.reply_text}"
  end

  exchange = channel.fanout("amq.fanout")

  channel.queue("", :auto_delete =&gt; true, :exclusive =&gt; true) do |queue, declare_ok|
    queue.bind(exchange)

    EventMachine.add_timer(0.5) do
      queue.unbind(exchange) do |_|
        puts "Unbound. Shutting down..."

        connection.close { EventMachine.stop }
      end
    end # EventMachine.add_timer
  end # channel.queue
end
</pre><p><span class="help-block">(if the example above isn&#8217;t displayed, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/998742">gist</a>)</span></p>
<p><span class="note">Trying to unbind a queue from an exchange that the queue was never bound to will result in achannel-level exception.</span></p>
<h2>Bindings, Routing and Returned Messages</h2>
<h3>How <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 Brokers Route Messages</h3>
<p>After <span class="caps">AMQP</span> message reaches <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker and before it reaches a consumer, several things happen:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker needs to find one or more queues the message needs to be routed to, depending on exchange</li>
	<li><span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker puts a copy of the message into each of those queues or decides to return the messages to the publisher</li>
	<li><span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker pushes messages to consumers on those queues or waits for applications to fetch them on demand</li>
</ul>
<p>A more in-depth description is this:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker needs to consult bindings list for the exchange the message was published to find one or more queues the message needs to be routed to (step 1)</li>
	<li>If there are no suitable queues found during step 1 and the message was published as mandatory, it is returned to the publisher (step 1b)</li>
	<li>If there are suitable queues, a <em>copy</em> of the message is placed into each one (step 2)</li>
	<li>If the message was published as mandatory, but there are no active consumers for it, it is returned to the publisher (step 2b)</li>
	<li>If there are active consumers on those queues and basic.qos setting permits, message is pushed to those consumers (step 3)</li>
	<li>If there are no active consumers and the message is <strong>not</strong> published as mandatory, it will be left in the queue</li>
</ul>
<p>The takeaway is that messages may or may not be routed and it is important for applications to handle unroutable messages.</p>
<h3>Handling of Unroutable Messages</h3>
<p>Unroutable messages are either dropped or returned back to producers. Vendor-specific extensions can provide additional ways of handing of unroutablemessages: for example, RabbitMQ&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#alternate-exchange">Alternate Exchanges extension</a> makes it possible to route unroutable messages to another exchange.amqp gem support for it is documented in the <a href="/articles/broker_specific_extensions/">Vendor-specific Extensions guide</a>.</p>
<p>RabbitMQ 2.6 will introduce a new feature callled dead letter queue where unroutable messages will be put instead of dropping them.</p>
<p>amqp gem provides a way to handle returned messages with the {AMQP::Exchange#on_return} method:</p>
<pre>exchange.on_return do |basic_return, metadata, payload|
  puts "#{payload} was returned! reply_code = #{basic_return.reply_code}, reply_text = #{basic_return.reply_text}"
end</pre>
