<h2>About this guide</h2>
<p>This guide explains how (and why) applications that use amqp gem versions 0.6.x and 0.7.x should migrate to 0.8.0 and future versions. It also outlines deprecated features, when and why they will be removed.</p>

<h2>Covered versions</h2>
<p>This guide covers <a href="http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp">Ruby amqp gem</a> v0.6.x and v0.7.&#215;.</p>
<h2>Brief history of amqp gem</h2>
<p>amqp gem was born in early July 2008. Since then, it has seen 7 releases, used by all kinds of companies, have been key component to systems that process more than 100 gigabytes of data per day and, despite not being a &#8220;1.0 library&#8221;, proven to be very usable.</p>
<p>For the most part of 2008 and 2009 the gem did not receive much of attention. In 2010, some other <span class="caps">AMQP</span> clients (for example, RabbitMQ Java &amp; .<span class="caps">NET</span> clients) switched to <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 specification. By the fall of 2010 it became clear that amqp gem needs a new team of maintainers, deep refactoring, new solid test suite and extensive documentation guides. Long story short, by December 2010, the <a href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp">new maintainers group</a> was formed and now maintains number of other libraries in the Ruby <span class="caps">AMQP</span> ecosystem, most notably the <a href="github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny">Bunny gem</a>.</p>
<p>Over first few months of 2011, amqp gem undergone a number of maintenance releases (known as 0.7.x series), a ground up rewrite of the test suite, major documentation update as well as a major refactoring. It was upgraded to <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 specification and based on a new, much more efficient <span class="caps">AMQP</span> serialization library, <a href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-protocol">amq-protocol</a>.</p>
<p>As part of this transition, amqp gem maintainers team pursued a number of goals:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Implement <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 spec plus all the RabbitMQ extensions</li>
	<li>End &#8220;300 of 1 patch forks&#8221; situation that had gotten especially bad in early 2010</li>
	<li>Produce a solid end-to-end test suite that imitates real asynchronous applications</li>
	<li>Resolve many <span class="caps">API</span> usability issues: inconsistent behavior, weird class and method naming, heavy reliance on implicit connection objects and so on</li>
	<li>Produce documentation guides that other <span class="caps">AMQP</span> client users will be envious of</li>
	<li>Define a stable public <span class="caps">API</span></li>
	<li>Improve memory efficiency and performance</li>
	<li>Resolve many limitations of the original <span class="caps">API</span> and implementation design</li>
	<li>Drop all the &#8220;experimental-stuff-that-was-never-finished&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, several projects like <a href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/evented-spec">evented-spec</a> were born and became part of the amqp gem family of libraries. &#8220;300 one patch forks&#8221; hell is a thing of the past. Even initial pure Ruby implementation of the new serialization library is <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/03/01/ruby-amqp-benchmarks/">several times as memory efficient</a>. <a href="http://bit.ly/amqp-gem-docs">Documentation guides</a> response if very positive. amqp gem 0.8.0.RCs implement all but 1 RabbitMQ extensions as well as <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 spec features original gem never implemented fully. Many large users of the gem upgraded to 0.8.0.RCs. The future for amqp gem and its spin-offs is bright.</p>
<h2>amqp gem 0.8.0 backwards compatibility policy</h2>
<p>amqp gem 0.8.0 is <strong>not 100% backwards compatible</strong>. That said, for most applications, upgrade path will be easy. Over 90% of the deprecated <span class="caps">API</span> classes &amp; methods are still in place and will only be dropped in the 0.9.0 release.</p>
<p>Plenty of incompatibilities between 0.6.x and 0.7.x series were ironed out in 0.8.0.RCs. Finally, this guide will explain what has changed, why, why it is the right thing to do and how you should adapt your application code.</p>
<h2>Why developers should upgrade to 0.8.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Great documentation</li>
	<li>amqp gem 0.8.0 RCs and later versions are actively maintained</li>
	<li>Largest library users either already switched to amqp gem 0.8.0 RCs or are switching in the near future (2011)</li>
	<li><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 spec implementation: many other popular clients, for example the RabbitMQ Java client, has dropped support for <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.8 specification</li>
	<li>RabbitMQ extensions</li>
	<li>Several <span class="caps">AMQP</span> brokers, including RabbitMQ (by far the most popular from the maintainers team observation), are planning to drop <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.8 spec support</li>
	<li>Applications that do not use depricated <span class="caps">API</span> features &amp; behaviors will have very seamless upgrade path to the amqp gem 0.9.0 and beyond</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span> protocol version change</h2>
<p>amqp gem before 0.8.0 (0.6.x, 0.7.x) series implemented (most of) <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.8 specification. amqp gem 0.8.0 implements <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 and thus <strong>requires RabbitMQ version 2.0 or later</strong>. See <a href="/articles/rabbitmq_versions/">RabbitMQ versions</a> for more information about RabbitMQ versions support and how obtain up-todate packages for your operating system.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
amqp gem 0.8.0 and later versions implement <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 and thus <strong>requires RabbitMQ version 2.0 or later</strong><br />
</span></p>
<h2>Follow established <span class="caps">AMQP</span> terminology</h2>
<h3>require &#8220;mq&#8221; is deprecated</h3>
<p>Instead of the following:</p>
<pre>require "amqp"
require "mq"</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>require "mq"</pre>
<p>switch to</p>
<pre>require "amqp"</pre>
<p><span class="note"><br />
mq.rb will be removed before 1.0 release.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>MQ class is deprecated</h3>
<p>Please use <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Channel"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel</a> instead. MQ class &amp; its methods are implemented in amqp gem 0.8.x for backwards compatibility, but only for transition period (that will end after 0.9 release).</p>
<p>Why is it deprecated? Because it was a poor name choice all along. Both mq.rb and MQ class step away from <span class="caps">AMQP</span> terminology and make 8 out of 10 engineers think it has something to do with <span class="caps">AMQP</span> queues (in fact, MQ should have been called Channel all along). No other <span class="caps">AMQP</span> client library we know of invents its own terminology when it comes to <span class="caps">AMQP</span> entities, and amqp gem shouldn&#8217;t, too.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
MQ class and class methods that use implicit connection (MQ.queue and so on) will be removed before 1.0 release.<br />
</span></p>
<h2>MQ class is now <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel</h2>
<p>MQ class was renamed to <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel to follow established <a href="/articles/amqp_9_1_model_explained/"><span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.9.1 terminology</a>. Implicit per-thread channels are deprecated so code like this:</p>
<pre># amqp gem 0.6.x code style: connection is implicit, channel is implicit. Error handling &amp; recovery are thus
# not possible.
# Deprecated, do not use.
MQ.queue("search.indexing")

# same for exchanges. Deprecated, do not use.
MQ.direct("services.imaging")
MQ.fanout("services.broadcast")
MQ.topic("services.weather_updates")</pre>

<pre># connection object lets you define error handlers
connection = AMQP.connect(:vhost =&gt; "myapp/production", :host =&gt; "192.168.0.18")
# channek object lets you define error handlers and use multiple channels per application,
# for example, one per thread
channel    = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
# AMQP::Channel#queue has unchanged otherwise
channel.queue("search.indexing")

# exchanges examples
channel.direct("services.imaging")
channel.fanout("services.broadcast")
channel.topic("services.weather_updates")</pre>
<p><span class="note"><br />
MQ.queue, MQ.direct, MQ.fanout and MQ.topic methods will be removed before 1.0 release. Use<br />
instance methods on <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel (<span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel#queue, <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel#direct, <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel#default_exchange<br />
and so on) instead.<br />
</span></p>
<h2>MQ::Queue is now <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue</h2>
<p>MQ::Queue is now <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue. All the methods from 0.6.x series are still available.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
MQ::Queue alias will be removed before 1.0 release. Please switch to <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue.<br />
</span></p>
<h2>MQ::Exchange is now <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Exchange</h2>
<p>MQ::Exchange is now <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Exchange. All the methods from 0.6.x series are still available.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
MQ::Exchange alias will be removed before 1.0 release. Please switch to <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Exchange.<br />
</span></p>
<h2>MQ::Header is now <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Header</h2>
<p>MQ::Header is now <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Header. If you code has any type checks or case matches on MQ::Header, it needs to change to <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Header.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span>.error is deprecated</h2>
<p>Catch-all solutions for error handling are very difficult to use. Automatic recovery and fine-grained event handling is also not possible. amqp gem 0.8.0.RC14 and later includes fine-grained <a href="/articles/error_handling/">Error Handling and Recovery <span class="caps">API</span></a> that is both significantly easier to use in real-world cases but also makes automatic recovery mode possible.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
<span class="caps">AMQP</span>.error method will be removed before 1.0 release.<br />
</span></p>
<h2>MQ::<span class="caps">RPC</span> is deprecated</h2>
<p>It was an experiment that was never finished. Some <span class="caps">API</span> design choices are very opinionated as well. amqp gem should not ship with half-baked poorly designed or overly opinionated solutions.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
MQ::<span class="caps">RPC</span> class will be removed before 1.0 release.<br />
</span></p>
<h2>MQ::Logger is removed</h2>
<p>It was an experiment that was never finished. Some <span class="caps">API</span> design choices are very opinionated as well. amqp gem should not ship with half-baked poorly designed or overly opinionated solutions.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
MQ::Logger class was removed in the the amqp gem 0.8.0 development cycle.<br />
</span></p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Buffer is removed</h2>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Buffer was <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.8 protocol implementation detail. With the new <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/amq-protocol">amq-protocol gem</a>, it is no longer relevant.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
<span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Buffer class was removed in the the amqp gem 0.8.0 development cycle.<br />
</span></p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Frame is removed</h2>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Frame was <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.8 protocol implementation detail. With the new <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/amq-protocol">amq-protocol gem</a>, it is no longer relevant.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
<span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Frame class was removed in the the amqp gem 0.8.0 development cycle.<br />
</span></p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Server is removed</h2>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Server was (an unfinished) toy implementation of <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.8 broker in Ruby on top of EventMachine. We believe that Ruby is not an optimal choice for <span class="caps">AMQP</span> broker implementations. We also never heard from anyone using it.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
<span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Server class was removed in the the amqp gem 0.8.0 development cycle.<br />
</span></p>
<h2><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Protocol::* classes are removed</h2>
<p><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Protocol::* classes were <span class="caps">AMQP</span> 0.8 protocol implementation detail. With the new <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/amq-protocol">amq-protocol gem</a>, they are no longer relevant.</p>
<p><span class="note"><br />
<span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Protocol::* classes were removed in the the amqp gem 0.8.0 development cycle.<br />
