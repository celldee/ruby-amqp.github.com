<h1>Getting Started with AMQP and Ruby</h1>
<h2>About this guide</h2>
<p>This guide is a quick tutorial that helps you to get started with v0.9.1 of the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> specification in general and the <a href="http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp">Ruby amqp gem</a> in particular.<br />
It should take about 20 minutes to read and study the provided code examples. This guide covers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Installing RabbitMQ, a mature popular server implementation of the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> protocol.</li>
	<li>Installing the amqp gem via <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems</a> and <a href="http://gembundler.com">Bundler</a>.</li>
	<li>Running a &#8220;Hello, world&#8221; messaging example that is a simple demonstration of 1:1 communication.</li>
	<li>Creating a &#8220;Twitter-like&#8221; publish/subscribe example with 1 publisher and 4 subscribers that demonstrates 1:n communication.</li>
	<li>Creating a topic routing example with 2 publishers and 8 subscribers showcasing n:m communication when subscribers only receive messages that they are interested in.</li>
	<li>Learning how the amqp gem can be integrated with Ruby objects in a way that makes unit testing easy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which versions of the amqp gem does this guide cover?</h2>
<p>This guide covers v0.8.0 and later of the <a href="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp">Ruby amqp gem</a>.</p>
<h2>Installing RabbitMQ</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ site</a> has a good <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html">installation guide</a> that addresses many operating systems.<br />
On Mac OS X, the fastest way to install RabbitMQ is with <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>:</p>
<p><code>brew install rabbitmq</code></p>
<p>then run it:</p>
<p><code>rabbitmq-server</code></p>
<p>On Debian and Ubuntu, you can either <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/server.html">download the RabbitMQ .deb package</a> and install it with <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-pkgtools.en.html">dpkg</a> or make use of the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian.html#apt">apt repository</a> that the RabbitMQ team provides.</p>
<p>For <span class="caps">RPM</span>-based distributions like RedHat or CentOS, the RabbitMQ team provides an <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html#rpm"><span class="caps">RPM</span> package</a>.</p>
<p><span class="help-block"><br />
<b>Note:</b> The RabbitMQ package that ships with recent Ubuntu versions (for example, 10.10) is outdated and <strong>will not work with v0.8.0 and later of the amqp gem</strong> (we need at least RabbitMQ v2.0 for use with this guide).<br />
</span></p>
<h2>Installing the Ruby amqp gem</h2>
<h3>Make sure that you have Ruby and <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3">Rubygems</a> installed</h3>
<p>This guide assumes that you have installed one of the following supported Ruby implementations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ruby v1.8.7</li>
	<li>Ruby v1.9.2</li>
	<li>Ruby v1.9.3</li>
	<li>JRuby (we recommend v1.6)</li>
	<li>Rubinius v1.2 or higher</li>
	<li>Ruby Enterprise Edition</li>
</ul>
<h3>You can use Rubygems to install the amqp gem</h3>
<h4>On Microsoft Windows 7:</h4>
<p><code>gem install eventmachine --pre
gem install amqp</code></p>
<h4>On other OSes or JRuby:</h4>
<p><code>gem install amqp</code></p>
<h3>You can also use Bundler to install the gem</h3>
<pre>source :rubygems
gem "amqp", "~&gt; 0.9.0" # optionally: :git =&gt; "git://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp.git", :branch =&gt; "0.9.x-stable"</pre>
<h3>Verifying your installation</h3>
<p>Let us verify your installation with this quick irb session:</p>
<p><code>irb -rubygems
:001 &gt; require "amqp"
=&gt; true
:002 &gt; AMQP::VERSION
=&gt; "0.9.0"</code></p>
<h2>&#8220;Hello, world&#8221; example</h2>
<p>Let us begin with the classic &#8220;Hello, world&#8221; example. First, here is the code (or you can view it on <a href="/articles/amqp/hello_world/index.html">rocco-style page</a>):</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "amqp"

EventMachine.run do
  connection = AMQP.connect(:host =&gt; '127.0.0.1')
  puts "Connected to AMQP broker. Running #{AMQP::VERSION} version of the gem..."

  channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
  queue    = channel.queue("amqpgem.examples.helloworld", :auto_delete =&gt; true)
  exchange = channel.direct("")

  queue.subscribe do |payload|
    puts "Received a message: #{payload}. Disconnecting..."
    connection.close { EventMachine.stop }
  end

  exchange.publish "Hello, world!", :routing_key =&gt; queue.name
end
</pre><p><span class="help-block">(if the example above isn&#8217;t displayed, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/998690">gist</a>)</span></p>
<p>This example demonstrates a very common communication scenario: <strong>application A</strong> wants to publish a message that will end up in a queue that <strong>application B</strong> listens on. In this case, the queue name is &#8220;amqpgem.examples.hello&#8221;. Let us go through the code step by step:</p>
<pre>require "rubygems"
require "amqp"</pre>
<p>is the simplest way to load the amqp gem if you have installed it with RubyGems. The following piece of code</p>
<pre>EventMachine.run do
  # ...
end</pre>
<p>runs what is called the <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com">EventMachine</a> reactor. We will not go into what the term &#8216;reactor&#8217; means here, but suffice it to say that the amqp gem is asynchronous and is based on an asynchronous network I/O library called <em>EventMachine</em>.</p>
<p>The next line</p>
<pre>connection = AMQP.connect(:host =&gt; '127.0.0.1')</pre>
<p>connects to the server running on localhost, with the default port (5672), username (guest), password (guest) and virtual host (&#8216;/&#8217;).</p>
<p>The next line</p>
<pre>channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)</pre>
<p>opens a new <em>channel</em>. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> is a multi-channeled protocol that uses channels to multiplex a <span class="caps">TCP</span> connection.</p>
<p>Channels are opened on a connection, therefore the <span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel constructor takes a connection object as a parameter.</p>
<p>This line</p>
<pre>queue    = channel.queue("amqpgem.examples.helloworld", :auto_delete =&gt; true)</pre>
<p>declares a <em>queue</em> on the channel that we have just opened. Consumer applications get messages from queues. We declared this queue with the &#8220;auto-delete&#8221; parameter. Basically, this means that the queue will be deleted when there are no more processes consuming messages from it.</p>
<p>The next line</p>
<pre>exchange = channel.direct("")</pre>
<p>instantiates an <em>exchange</em>. Exchanges receive messages that are sent by producers. Exchanges route messages to queues according to rules called <em>bindings</em>. In this particular example, there are no explicitly defined bindings. The exchange that we defined is known as the <em>default exchange</em> and it has implied bindings to all queues. Before we get into that, let us see how we define a handler for incoming messages</p>
<pre>queue.subscribe do |payload|
  puts "Received a message: #{payload}. Disconnecting..."
  connection.close { EventMachine.stop }
end</pre>
<p><a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Queue#subscribe-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue#subscribe</a> takes a block that will be called every time a message arrives. <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Session#close-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Session#close</a> closes the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> connection and runs a callback that stops the EventMachine reactor.</p>
<p>Finally, we publish our message</p>
<pre>exchange.publish "Hello, world!", :routing_key =&gt; queue.name</pre>
<p>Routing key is one of the <em>message attributes</em>. The default exchange will route the message to a queue that has the same name as the message&#8217;s routing key. This is how our message ends up in the &#8220;amqpgem.examples.helloworld&#8221; queue.</p>
<p>This first example can be modified to use the method chaining technique:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "amqp"

EventMachine.run do
  AMQP.connect(:host =&gt; '127.0.0.1') do |connection|
    puts "Connected to AMQP broker. Running #{AMQP::VERSION} version of the gem..."

    channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)

    channel.queue("amqpgem.examples.helloworld", :auto_delete =&gt; true).subscribe do |payload|
      puts "Received a message: #{payload}. Disconnecting..."

      connection.close { EventMachine.stop }
    end

    channel.direct("").publish "Hello, world!", :routing_key =&gt; "amqpgem.examples.helloworld"
  end
end
</pre><p><span class="help-block">(if the example above isn&#8217;t displayed, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/998691">gist</a>)</span></p>
<p>This diagram demonstrates the &#8220;Hello, world&#8221; example data flow:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/raw/master/docs/diagrams/001_hello_world_example_routing.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, both the message producer (App I) and the consumer (App II) are running in the same Ruby process. Now let us move on to a little bit more sophisticated example.</p>
<h2>Blabblr: one-to-many publish/subscribe (pubsub) example</h2>
<p>The previous example demonstrated how a connection to a broker is made and how to do 1:1 communication using the default exchange. Now let us take a look at another common scenario: broadcast, or multiple consumers and one producer.</p>
<p>A very well-known broadcast example is Twitter: every time a person tweets, followers receive a notification. Blabbr, our imaginary information network, models this scenario: every network member has a separate queue and publishes blabs to a separate exchange. 3 Blabbr members, Joe, Aaron and Bob, follow the official <span class="caps">NBA</span> account on Blabbr to get updates about what is happening in the world of basketball. Here is the code:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "amqp"

AMQP.start("amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com:5672") do |connection|
  channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
  exchange = channel.fanout("nba.scores")

  channel.queue("joe", :auto_delete =&gt; true).bind(exchange).subscribe do |payload|
    puts "#{payload} =&gt; joe"
  end

  channel.queue("aaron", :auto_delete =&gt; true).bind(exchange).subscribe do |payload|
    puts "#{payload} =&gt; aaron"
  end

  channel.queue("bob", :auto_delete =&gt; true).bind(exchange).subscribe do |payload|
    puts "#{payload} =&gt; bob"
  end

  exchange.publish("BOS 101, NYK 89").publish("ORL 85, ALT 88")

  # disconnect &amp; exit after 2 seconds
  EventMachine.add_timer(2) do
    exchange.delete

    connection.close { EventMachine.stop }
  end
end
</pre><p><span class="help-block">(if the example above isn&#8217;t displayed, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/998692">gist</a>)</span></p>
<p>The first line has a few differences from the &#8220;Hello, world&#8221; example above:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We use <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP#start-class_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>.start</a> instead of <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP#connect-class_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>.connect</a></li>
	<li>Instead of return values, we pass a block to the connection method and it yields a connection<br />
   object back as soon as the connection is established.</li>
	<li>Instead of passing connection parameters as a hash, we use a <span class="caps">URI</span> string.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP#start-class_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>.start</a> is just a convenient way to do</p>
<pre>EventMachine.run do
  AMQP.connect(options) do |connection|
    # ...
  end
end</pre>
<p>The <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP#start-class_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>.start</a> call blocks the current thread which means that its use is limited to scripts and small command line applications. Blabbr is just that.</p>
<p><a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP#connect-class_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>.connect</a>, when invoked with a block, will yield a connection object as soon as the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> connection is open. Finally, connection parameters may be supplied as a Hash or as a connection string. The {AMQP.connect} method documentation contains all of the details.</p>
<p>In this example, opening a channel is no different to opening a channel in the previous example, however, the exchange is declared differently</p>
<pre>exchange = channel.fanout("nba.scores")</pre>
<p>The exchange that we declare above using <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Channel#fanout-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel#fanout</a> is a <em>fanout exchange</em>. A fanout exchange delivers messages to all of the queues that are bound to it: exactly what we want in the case of Blabbr!</p>
<p>This piece of code</p>
<pre>channel.queue("joe", :auto_delete =&gt; true).bind(exchange).subscribe do |payload|
  puts "#{payload} =&gt; joe"
end</pre>
<p>is similar to the subscription code that we used for message delivery previously, but what does that <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Queue#bind-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue#bind</a> method do? It sets up a binding between the queue and the exchange that you pass to it. We need to do this to make sure that our fanout exchange routes messages to the queues of any subscribed followers.</p>
<pre>exchange.publish("BOS 101, NYK 89").publish("ORL 85, ALT 88")</pre>
<p>demonstrates <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Exchange#publish-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Exchange#publish</a> call chaining. Blabbr members use a fanout exchange for publishing, so there is no need to specify a message routing key because every queue that is bound to the exchange will get its own copy of all messages, regardless of the queue name and routing key used.</p>
<p>A diagram for Blabbr looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/raw/master/docs/diagrams/002_blabbr_example_routing.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Next we use EventMachine&#8217;s {http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine.html#M000466 add_timer} method to run a piece of code in 1 second from now:</p>
<pre>EventMachine.add_timer(1) do
  exchange.delete
  connection.close { EventMachine.stop }
end</pre>
<p>The code that we want to run deletes the exchange that we declared earlier using <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Exchange#delete-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Exchange#delete</a> and closes the <span class="caps">AMQP</span> connection with <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Session#close-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Session#close</a>. Finally, we stop the EventMachine event loop and exit.</p>
<p>Blabbr is pretty unlikely to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, but it does a pretty good job of demonstrating how one can use <span class="caps">AMQP</span> fanout exchanges to do broadcasting.</p>
<h2>Weathr: many-to-many topic routing example</h2>
<p>So far, we have seen point-to-point communication and broadcasting. Those two communication styles are possible with many protocols, for instance, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> handles these scenarios just fine. You may ask &#8220;what differentiates <span class="caps">AMQP</span>?&#8221; Well, next we are going to introduce you to <em>topic exchanges</em> and routing with patterns, one of the features that makes <span class="caps">AMQP</span> very powerful.</p>
<p>Our third example involves weather condition updates. What makes it different from the previous two examples is that not all of the consumers are interested in all of the messages. People who live in Portland usually do not care about the weather in Hong Kong (unless they are visiting soon). They are much more interested in weather conditions around Portland, possibly all of Oregon and sometimes a few neighbouring states.</p>
<p>Our example features multiple consumer applications monitoring updates for different regions. Some are interested in updates for a specific city, others for a specific state and so on, all the way up to continents. Updates may overlap so that an update for San Diego, CA appears as an update for California, but also should show up on the North America updates list.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "amqp"

EventMachine.run do
  AMQP.connect do |connection|
    channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
    exchange = channel.topic("pub/sub", :auto_delete =&gt; true)

    # Subscribers.
    channel.queue("", :exclusive =&gt; true) do |queue|
      queue.bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "americas.north.#").subscribe do |headers, payload|
        puts "An update for North America: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
      end
    end
    channel.queue("americas.south").bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "americas.south.#").subscribe do |headers, payload|
      puts "An update for South America: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
    end
    channel.queue("us.california").bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "americas.north.us.ca.*").subscribe do |headers, payload|
      puts "An update for US/California: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
    end
    channel.queue("us.tx.austin").bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "#.tx.austin").subscribe do |headers, payload|
      puts "An update for Austin, TX: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
    end
    channel.queue("it.rome").bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "europe.italy.rome").subscribe do |headers, payload|
      puts "An update for Rome, Italy: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
    end
    channel.queue("asia.hk").bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "asia.southeast.hk.#").subscribe do |headers, payload|
      puts "An update for Hong Kong: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
    end

    EM.add_timer(1) do
      exchange.publish("San Diego update", :routing_key =&gt; "americas.north.us.ca.sandiego").
        publish("Berkeley update",         :routing_key =&gt; "americas.north.us.ca.berkeley").
        publish("San Francisco update",    :routing_key =&gt; "americas.north.us.ca.sanfrancisco").
        publish("New York update",         :routing_key =&gt; "americas.north.us.ny.newyork").
        publish("Sao Paolo update",        :routing_key =&gt; "americas.south.brazil.saopaolo").
        publish("Hong Kong update",        :routing_key =&gt; "asia.southeast.hk.hongkong").
        publish("Kyoto update",            :routing_key =&gt; "asia.southeast.japan.kyoto").
        publish("Shanghai update",         :routing_key =&gt; "asia.southeast.prc.shanghai").
        publish("Rome update",             :routing_key =&gt; "europe.italy.roma").
        publish("Paris update",            :routing_key =&gt; "europe.france.paris")
    end


    show_stopper = Proc.new {
      connection.close { EventMachine.stop }
    }

    EM.add_timer(2, show_stopper)
  end
end
</pre><p><span class="help-block">(if the example above isn&#8217;t displayed, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/998694">gist</a>)</span></p>
<p>The first line that is different from the Blabbr example is</p>
<pre>exchange = channel.topic("pub/sub", :auto_delete =&gt; true)</pre>
<p>We use a topic exchange here. Topic exchanges are used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast">multicast</a> messaging where consumers indicate which topics they are interested in (think of it as subscribing to a feed for an individual tag in your favourite blog as opposed to the full feed). Routing with a topic exchange is done by specifying a <em>routing pattern</em> on binding, for example:</p>
<pre>channel.queue("americas.south").bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "americas.south.#").subscribe do |headers, payload|
  puts "An update for South America: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
end</pre>
<p>Here we bind a queue with the name of &#8220;americas.south&#8221; to the topic exchange declared earlier using the <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Queue#bind-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue#bind</a> method.  This means that only messages with a routing key matching &#8220;americas.south.#&#8221; will be routed to that queue. A routing pattern consists of several words separated by dots, in a similar way to <span class="caps">URI</span> path segments joined by slashes. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>asia.southeast.thailand.bangkok</li>
	<li>sports.basketball</li>
	<li>usa.nasdaq.aapl</li>
	<li>tasks.search.indexing.accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us take a look at a few routing keys that match the &#8220;americas.south.#&#8221; pattern:</p>
<ul>
	<li>americas.south</li>
	<li>americas.south.<strong>brazil</strong></li>
	<li>americas.south.<strong>brazil.saopaolo</strong></li>
	<li>americas.south.<strong>chile.santiago</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the &#8220;#&#8221; part of the pattern matches 0 or more words.</p>
<p>For a pattern like &#8220;americas.south.*&#8221;, some matching routing keys would be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>americas.south.<strong>brazil</strong></li>
	<li>americas.south.<strong>chile</strong></li>
	<li>americas.south.<strong>peru</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>but not</p>
<ul>
	<li>americas.south</li>
	<li>americas.south.chile.santiago</li>
</ul>
<p>so &#8220;*&#8221; only matches a single word. The <span class="caps">AMQP</span> v0.9.1 specification says that topic segments (words) may contain the letters A-Z and a-z and digits 0-9.</p>
<p>A (very simplistic) diagram to demonstrate topic exchange in action:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp/raw/master/docs/diagrams/003_weathr_example_routing.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>One more thing that is different from previous examples is that the block we pass to <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Queue#subscribe-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue#subscribe</a> now takes two arguments: a <em>header</em> and a <em>body</em> (often called the <em>payload</em>). Long story short, the header parameter lets you access metadata associated with the message. Some examples of message metadata attributes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>message content type</li>
	<li>message content encoding</li>
	<li>message priority</li>
	<li>message expiration time</li>
	<li>message identifier</li>
	<li>reply to (specifies which message this is a reply to)</li>
	<li>application id (identifier of the application that produced the message)</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>As the following binding demonstrates, &#8220;#&#8221; and &#8220;*&#8221; can also appear at the beginning of routing patterns:</p>
<pre>channel.queue("us.tx.austin").bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "#.tx.austin").subscribe do |headers, payload|
  puts "An update for Austin, TX: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
end</pre>
<p>For this example the publishing of messages is no different from that of previous examples. If we were to run the program, a message published with a routing key of &#8220;americas.north.us.ca.berkeley&#8221; would be routed to 2 queues: &#8220;us.california&#8221; and the <em>server-named queue</em> that we declared by passing a blank string as the name:</p>
<pre>channel.queue("", :exclusive =&gt; true) do |queue|
  queue.bind(exchange, :routing_key =&gt; "americas.north.#").subscribe do |headers, payload|
    puts "An update for North America: #{payload}, routing key is #{headers.routing_key}"
  end
end</pre>
<p>The name of the server-named queue is generated by the broker and sent back to the client with a queue declaration confirmation. Because the queue name is not known before the reply arrives, we pass <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Channel#queue-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel#queue</a> a callback and it yields us back a queue object once confirmation has arrived.</p>
<h3>Avoid race conditions</h3>
<p>A word of warning: you may find examples on the Web of <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Channel#queue-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel#queue</a> usage that do not use callbacks. We <strong>recommend that you use a callback for server-named queues</strong>, otherwise your code may be subject to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">race conditions</a>. Even though the amqp gem tries to be reasonably smart and protect you from most common problems (for example, binding operations will be delayed until after queue name is received from the broker), there is no way it can do so for every case. The primary reason for supporting <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Channel#queue-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Channel#queue</a> usage without a callback for server-named queues is backwards compatibility with earlier versions.</p>
<h2>Integration with objects</h2>
<p>Since Ruby is a genuine object-oriented language, it is important to demonstrate how the Ruby amqp gem can be integrated into rich object-oriented code.</p>
<p>The <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Queue#subscribe-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue#subscribe</a> callback does not have to be a block. It can be any Ruby object that responds to `call`. A common technique is to combine {http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/1.8.7/Object:method Object#method} and {http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/1.8.7/Method:to_proc Method#to_proc} and use object methods as message handlers.</p>
<p>An example to demonstrate this technique:</p>
<pre>class Consumer

  #
  # API
  #

  def handle_message(metadata, payload)
    puts "Received a message: #{payload}, content_type = #{metadata.content_type}"
  end # handle_message(metadata, payload)
end


class Worker

  #
  # API
  #


  def initialize(channel, queue_name = AMQ::Protocol::EMPTY_STRING, consumer = Consumer.new)
    @queue_name = queue_name

    @channel    = channel
    @channel.on_error(&amp;method(:handle_channel_exception))

    @consumer   = consumer
  end # initialize

  def start
    @queue = @channel.queue(@queue_name, :exclusive =&gt; true)
    @queue.subscribe(&amp;@consumer.method(:handle_message))
  end # start



  #
  # Implementation
  #

  def handle_channel_exception(channel, channel_close)
    puts "Oops... a channel-level exception: code = #{channel_close.reply_code}, message = #{channel_close.reply_text}"
  end # handle_channel_exception(channel, channel_close)
end
</pre>
<p>The &#8220;Hello, world&#8221; example can be ported to use this technique:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# encoding: utf-8

require "rubygems"
require "amqp"

class Consumer

  #
  # API
  #

  def handle_message(metadata, payload)
    puts "Received a message: #{payload}, content_type = #{metadata.content_type}"
  end # handle_message(metadata, payload)
end


class Worker

  #
  # API
  #


  def initialize(channel, queue_name = AMQ::Protocol::EMPTY_STRING, consumer = Consumer.new)
    @queue_name = queue_name

    @channel    = channel
    @channel.on_error(&amp;method(:handle_channel_exception))

    @consumer   = consumer
  end # initialize

  def start
    @queue = @channel.queue(@queue_name, :exclusive =&gt; true)
    @queue.subscribe(&amp;@consumer.method(:handle_message))
  end # start



  #
  # Implementation
  #

  def handle_channel_exception(channel, channel_close)
    puts "Oops... a channel-level exception: code = #{channel_close.reply_code}, message = #{channel_close.reply_text}"
  end # handle_channel_exception(channel, channel_close)
end


class Producer

  #
  # API
  #

  def initialize(channel, exchange)
    @channel  = channel
    @exchange = exchange
  end # initialize(channel, exchange)

  def publish(message, options = {})
    @exchange.publish(message, options)
  end # publish(message, options = {})


  #
  # Implementation
  #

  def handle_channel_exception(channel, channel_close)
    puts "Oops... a channel-level exception: code = #{channel_close.reply_code}, message = #{channel_close.reply_text}"
  end # handle_channel_exception(channel, channel_close)
end


AMQP.start("amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com") do |connection, open_ok|
  channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(connection)
  worker   = Worker.new(channel, "amqpgem.objects.integration")
  worker.start

  producer = Producer.new(channel, channel.default_exchange)
  puts "Publishing..."
  producer.publish("Hello, world", :routing_key =&gt; "amqpgem.objects.integration")

  # stop in 2 seconds
  EventMachine.add_timer(2.0) { connection.close { EventMachine.stop } }
end
</pre><p><span class="help-block">(if the example above isn&#8217;t displayed, see this <a href="https://gist.github.com/1009447">gist</a>)</span></p>
<p>The most important line in this example is</p>
<pre>@queue.subscribe(&amp;@consumer.method(:handle_message))</pre>
<p>Ampersand (&amp;) preceding an object is equivalent to calling the #to_proc method on it. We obtain a Consumer#handle_message method reference with</p>
<pre>@consumer.method(:handle_message)</pre>
<p>and then the ampersand calls #to_proc on it. <a class="highlight" href="http://rubydoc.info/github/ruby-amqp/amqp/master/AMQP/Queue#subscribe-instance_method"><span class="caps">AMQP</span>::Queue#subscribe</a> then will be using this Proc instance to handle incoming messages.</p>
<p>Note that the `Consumer` class above can be easily tested in isolation, without spinning up any <span class="caps">AMQP</span> connections.<br />
Here is one example using <a href="http://relishapp.com/rspec">RSpec</a></p>
<pre>require "ostruct"
require "json"

# RSpec example
describe Consumer do
  describe "when a new message arrives" do
    subject { described_class.new }

    let(:metadata) do
      o = OpenStruct.new

      o.content_type = "application/json"
      o
    end
    let(:payload)  { JSON.encode({ :command =&gt; "reload_config" }) }

    it "does some useful work" do
      # check preconditions here if necessary

      subject.handle_message(metadata, payload)

      # add your code expectations here
    end
  end
end</pre>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>This is the end of the tutorial. Congratulations! You have learned quite a bit about both <span class="caps">AMQP</span> v0.9.1 and the amqp gem. This is only the tip of the iceberg. <span class="caps">AMQP</span> has many more features built into the protocol:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reliable delivery of messages</li>
	<li>Message confirmations (a way to tell broker that a message was or was not processed successfully)</li>
	<li>Message redelivery when consumer applications fail or crash</li>
	<li>Load balancing of messages between multiple consumers</li>
	<li>Message metadata attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on. Other guides explain these features in depth, as well as use cases for them. To stay up to date with amqp gem development, <a href="http://twitter.com/rubyamqp">follow @rubyamqp on Twitter</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-amqp">join our mailing list</a>.</p>
